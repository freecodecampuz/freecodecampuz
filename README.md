- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in computer science originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, found an actual moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. She famously taped the moth into the computer's logbook, coining the term "debugging" when referring to fixing errors in computer code.
